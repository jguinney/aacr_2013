Abstract  Our preliminary data show that erlotinib inhibits Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a xenograft model.

We have discovered that obtaining information regarding whether such clinical molecular tests were done, and what were the results, is not easy or straightforward, even in settings such as Kaiser Permanente, which has had almost completely electronic medical records for several years.  This is particularly the case for tests that are sent to a commercial laboratory (recently, Kaiser Permanente Northern California has brought KRAS testing in house).  This is a substantial limitation for studying the actual clinical use and effectiveness of such tests in a real-world setting, as there is no standard set of codes that differentiate each individual test, and results from outside laboratories (e.g., Quest, Myriad, etc.) typically come as paper (or electronic) reports that sometimes are transcribed into the EMR as text fields, sometimes are scanned and attached to the EMR, and sometimes are not available at all.  This is a challenge that will need to be rectified if studies of the effectiveness and appropriate utilization of such tests are to be carried out in a cost-effective manner.  More generally, incorporation of data from genetic tests into clinical records is a challenge that health care providers with EMR systems are grappling with."</td></tr>
